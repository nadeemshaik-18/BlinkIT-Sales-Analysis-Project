## Business Requirements
The primary goal is to evaluate BlinkIT's performance on multiple fronts, including:
- Sales performance by item characteristics (e.g., fat content, item type)
- Outlet performance based on establishment age, size, and location
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess sales, ratings, and inventory distribution

### Key KPIs

2. **Total Sales by Item Type**: A bar chart to identify item type performance.
3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales**: A stacked column chart comparing sales across outlets by fat content.
4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment**: A line chart to evaluate sales by outlet age or establishment type.
5. **Sales by Outlet Size**: A donut/pie chart showing correlation between outlet size and sales.
6. **Sales by Outlet Location**: A funnel map for geographic sales distribution.
7. **All Metrics by Outlet Type**: A matrix card for a detailed breakdown of KPIs by outlet type.

## Insights and Findings
- **Impact of Fat Content**: Sales performance varied based on the fat content of items, with certain fat levels associated with higher sales and ratings.
